# canardpc

I was bored so I remade the application of CanardPC. Still an early prototype but I'm pretty about what I made with it and I think it's pretty. 
I offer to CanardPC to remake their app with this as a PoK but they declined because of no time to devote to that which I understand. I probably won't work on this anymore.
I was fun tho and I may continue in the future for a personnal use
